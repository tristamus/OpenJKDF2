// "Imperial Network Protocol" relay protocol, shared by the game client
// (jkrelay_client.c) and the server (tools/jkrelay/jkrelay_server.c).
//
// Every player keeps one UDP "connection" to the relay server and the server
// forwards game traffic between the players of a session. Only outbound
// traffic is needed on the players' side, so no port forwarding: the server
// is the only machine that must be reachable. Hosts and joiners can also get
// a direct link (see "Direct links" below).
//
// The relay replaces DirectPlay's transport only. The game's own messages
// (DSS) are carried unchanged, so gameplay is identical to DirectPlay games.
//
// All integers are little-endian. Every packet starts with jkr_hdr.

// Resuming (2026-10-27). When the server restarts, every session on it is
// gone, but the games themselves go on (they live on the players' machines,
// and direct links keep carrying data). The server answers packets with an
// unknown token with JKR_UNKNOWN; a client in a game then handshakes again
// (HELLO) and puts its game back:
//   host:   JKR_REHOST  appGuid[16], desc (its guid kept), password, join ext,

//   players = u8 count, count x (u32 id, u32 flags, name): the sender's own,
//             its system player first
// Player ids stay the same, so the game never notices. The server takes
// REJOINs for a game only within JKR_REJOIN_WINDOW_MS after its REHOST (until
// the host is back: FAIL NOSESSIONS, and the joiner retries; later: FAIL
// ACCESSDENIED, and the joiner gives up), and tells everyone about the
// returning players as "initial" PLAYER_CREATED events. Players who don't come
// back are removed by each client JKR_REJOIN_WINDOW_MS after it resumed. A host
// keeps its game while the server is away and resumes whenever it's back; a
// joiner gives up after JKR_RESUME_MS unless it has a direct link to the host.

//   u32 IPv4 (host order), u16 port, u8 flags (JKR_LA_*)

// Rcon through a relay (2026-10-29): a dedicated server hosting on a relay server

// the game: "JKRT" and the game's guid (JKR_RCON_TAG_SIZE bytes) at the start of
// the CHALLENGE's padding, and after the RCON's command. A relay server passes such
// a packet on to that game's host as JKR_TUNNEL, with where it came from; the host
// checks it as its own server would (the password never reaches the relay) and
// sends its answers back as JKR_TUNNEL_REPLY, which the relay sends on, only to an

// server ignores the tag; older relay servers ignore the packets (no answer).

//                   the player's machine is told why (JKR_EV_SESSION_LOST) and taken
//                   out -> OK u32 its IPv4 (network order), or FAIL
//   JKR_SETBANS     u16 count, then u32 IPv4 (network order), u16 minutes left (0 for
//                   good) each: the game's bans, which JOIN and REJOIN are refused
//                   for (JKR_LOST_BANNED), replacing the last list -> OK
//   JKR_PLAYERADDR  u32 player id -> OK u32 IPv4, u16 port (network order), or FAIL
// Gateway (2026-10-29): browsers can't send UDP, so a relay server that takes
// WebSockets (-w) also carries their packets to the dedicated servers it lists as
// master server, which then play with them as with any player. A browser opens a
// WebSocket to <the relay's address>?to=a.b.c.d:port (a server the relay lists,
// and reached); each message it sends goes to that server as JKR_VIA with the
// browser's own address, from the relay server's port, and what the server sends
// back as JKR_VIA for that address goes to that WebSocket. A dedicated server takes
// JKR_VIA only from its master server, and answers players reached that way the
// same way, so bans, status and rcon see their own addresses. LIST flag
// JKR_LF_GATEWAY asks for the listed servers for browsers: a relay server that
// carries them says so with JKR_LR_GATEWAY (an older one may list them anyway,
// with JKR_LF_SERVERS, without it: browsers can't reach those).
