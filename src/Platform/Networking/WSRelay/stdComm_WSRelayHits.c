// Hit what you see: hit rules a host can pick on its host screen
// (jkGuiNetHost) instead of Classic, the default. The game that made an
// attack decides what it hit, by what its player saw, and the target's game
// checks each hit before it counts (stdComm_WSRelayHitCheck.h). Classic
// keeps the original rules, where each game decides the hits on its own
// player by where it has the attacker and the attack: about a round trip of
// the network ago, so a swing or a shot that hit on the attacker's screen
// often missed there.
//
// In a match played by Hit what you see:
//   - When this game's attack (its player's saber swing, a shot it fired, or
//     that shot's blast) hits another player, it sends that player's game a
//     claim: what hit, how hard, where it showed the target, and which of the
//     target's position updates it had on screen. Here the hit only shows,
//     as before: other players never take damage in this game.
//   - That game checks the claim against where its player was and applies
//     it through the usual code (shields, Force powers, death and kill
//     credit), or turns it down, and tells the attacker's hit ledger
//     (packaging/wasm/netstats.js) which, with a receipt.
//   - Another game's attack on this game's player only shows here, since
//     that game sends the claim. Blocks the same: the attacker's game
//     decides them by what it shows.
//   - A bolt this game fired stays this game's to decide after another
//     player's saber turns it away: it tells the other games the bolt's new
//     path (TURNED), and their copies follow it.
//   - A charge set off early (a mine touched, or a charge hit) is set off by
//     the game that fired it, or by the game whose player set it off, which
//     tells the others (DETONATE).
//   - A game's own player can't turn a bolt away until the fire wait after
//     their swing is over (sithWeapon_fireWait), so each swing tells the
//     other games how long that is (WAIT), for the bolts they decide. A
//     game that draws them from their timed updates has them in it while
//     the moment it draws them at is.
//   - A targeted Force power (Grip, Pull, Blinding, Deadly Sight) is still
//     the attacker's game's to aim: it picks a player it shows in reach and
//     sends their game the power's cog message (SkillTarget). Between two
//     games that draw each other from their timed updates, the message also
//     says the moment the player was drawn at and where it showed them
//     (stdComm_WSRelay_ForceMoment), and their game plays it only if they
//     were there then, as it checks a claim's last step.
// Everything else stays as it was: the host's damage messages, falls, world
// traps, and a player's own attacks on itself.
//
// Two games play by claims with each other only once each has said hello
// (HELLO, with the rules it plays by) and heard the other's. An older build
// never says hello, so with it hits stay as they were, both ways. Hello
// version 2 is a game that draws other players from buffers of their timed
// updates (stdComm_WSRelayMotion.c): two such games send each other times
// on their updates, and claims that name the moment the target was drawn
// at, which its game checks its record at. Version 3 also claims the
// explosions a blast makes in turn (a MotS flash bomb's): an older game
// decides those for its own player and never claims them, so with one they
// stay as they were, both ways. Version 1 gets Phase 2 claims. Jedi Knight
// and MotS games say the same version.
//
// All of it is one engine message, past DSS_MAX so older engines ignore it
// (STDCOMM_WSRELAY_HITS_MSG), sent without a resend id: the links under it
// already resend and keep order, and a claim that came a resend later would
// be past its reach anyway. First byte: type.
